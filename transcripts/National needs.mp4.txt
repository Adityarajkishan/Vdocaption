India has faced a lot of hypocrisy from a lot of countries since independence. So how far do we forgive and forget in this ever changing geopolitics and how do we make these decisions? Thank you. Forgive and forget. Do you forgive and forget? You should never forget. It's a big mistake. If you forget, you are not learning the lessons from it. If you forgive it depends what you are forgiving some things I will never forget. You know, if somebody attacked my city, if somebody violated my sovereignty, I will never forget it and I would never forget it. So forgive and forget is nice in personal relations. I think nations need to have longer and better memories.
